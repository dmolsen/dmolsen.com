The [Mobile Web Open Source Project][1] (OSP) was initially developed during the summer of 2009 and is a fork of the [original v0.9 release][2] of the MIT Mobile Web project that can still be found on SourceForge. The project was updated in May 2010 with the [release of version 2.0][3]. It is a product designed to make it easier for higher education institutions to deliver mobile-optimized information and services. It helps deliver task-based content like maps, events, and directory information optimized for device "families." This project is still under active development.

The [code for the project][4] can be found on GitHub. The project is [fully documented][1] and updates to it can be found on Twitter, [@mobilewebosp][5].
