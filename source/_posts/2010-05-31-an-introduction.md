I guess every blog needs some sort of set-up for a first post (though I'm putting this at the top for the launch). For the last year I've been doing mobile development on and off at [West Virginia University][1]. We've implemented a few mobile sites, released an [open source mobile framework][2], integrated a student developed iPhone app with campus resources, used QR codes and a mobile site in a coordinated campaign, allowed prospective students to check their application status via text messagingâ€¦ just a boatload of things. This great post from [@fienen][3], "[Best of Mobile Higher Ed Web][4]", has spurred me to enter the blogging world to share my own experiences as well as tips and tricks related to delivering mobile solutions in a higher ed setting. Hopefully what I share is helpful to those embarking down a similar path.

Oh, one thing to be clear about, I work for the marketing arm of our university. That means I sometimes don't see the academic uses of tech since I'm not faced with that as a problem set. So the blog as a whole may skew towards marketing.
