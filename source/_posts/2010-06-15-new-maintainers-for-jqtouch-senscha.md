For those folks using [jQTouch][1] the [big news][2] this morning is that the company called ExtJS which maintains the ExtJS library has now taken over support for jQTouch (*as well as [Raphael][3], a vector graphics JS library*) and renamed themselves [Sencha][4]. Their is also a new official maintainer for jQTouch in [Jonathan Stark][5]. I've been a fan of jQTouch for a bit and use it in [Mobile Web OSP][6] and [WVU Mobile Web][7] so this more official support is welcome. I had been wondering if the library had fallen a bit by the wayside and was set to be overtaken. Hopefully their's an update from Jonathan soon on what this means from the library and where things are going (*stable 1.0 soon, please?*). I'm also curious if this means ExtJS rather than jQuery will power the library in the future. [@senchainc][8] and [@jonathanstark][9] on Twitter.
