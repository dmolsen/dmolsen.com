I'm always really curious to see what other schools come up with when designing their mobile solutions. I hope to share some of the more unique or interesting ones in a "Design Patterns" series. I've included three different takes in my first batch:

## <span style="font-weight: normal;">Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</span>

The [MIT mobile site][1] is the granddaddy of a few mobile sites out there (including [West Virginia University's][2]). Nice that it degrades gracefully across multiple devices so that pretty much anyone can get at the data. It has an iPhone homescreen-like look for iPhone devices. Some might say that's not that original but I've found that there are very few ways of packing in a whole lot of sections into a very small amount of real estate. If a design functions well then use it. iPhone version on the left and smartphone version on the right.

## <span style="font-weight: normal;">University of Notre Dame</span>

The [University of Notre Dame mobile site][5] is based on the original v0.9 code from MIT. Obviously the main screen looks a bit different that what you see from other MIT-based sites. It was the first MIT-based site that I saw that I had worked in some nice original features like the open computer section and PrayerCast.

## <span style="font-weight: normal;">The University of Alabama</span>

I saw the [University of Alabama's mobile site][7] pop-up on [MobileAwesomeness.com][8] *(an interesting site for ideas if you ignore the ratings which seem heavily skewed towards design houses)*. I really love the clean layout and theme for the site. I also like the clear branding that occurs throughout your use of the site. The choice to useÂ [Google Static Maps][9] even on the iPhone is interesting. I have to agree that the weight of the JavaScript even in the mobile optimized v[ersion 3 of Google Maps API][10] does make it a hard choice to sometimes to include if you're looking to make the fastest/lightest site you can (which is sort of the definition of mobile). iPhone version on the left and smartphone version on the right.
