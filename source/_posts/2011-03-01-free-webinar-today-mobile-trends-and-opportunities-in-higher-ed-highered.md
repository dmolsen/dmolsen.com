For the last few weeks I've my head down working on a set of surprisingly complicated mobile projects. They launch tomorrow so I won't be able to attend this webinar but I wanted to pass it along to folks following this blog. These folks presented a webinar a while back and, while I also missed out on watching it then, the slidedeck was really good so I'm sure you'll get a lot out of it. So if you're on the East Coast schedule your lunch break around this one. On the West Coast? Why don't you ease into the day by watching it.

> The College of William & Mary and mStoner will jointly present Mobile Trends and Opportunities on Tuesday, March 1, 2011 at 12:30PM (ET).
> 
> This webinar will be led by Doug Gapinski ([@thedougco][1]), a creative director at mStoner, Susan T. Evans ([@susantevans][2]), director of creative services at William & Mary, and Tiffany Broadbent ([@tb623][3]), web programmer at William & Mary. The online event is free but registration is required atÂ <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www3.gotomeeting.com/register/340142510">https://www3.gotomeeting.com/register/340142510</a>

> Join us for a session exploring the trends and challenges associated with mobile delivery for education institutions today. Tune in if you have any or all of the following on your mind:
> 
> *   What can mobile site delivery do for your institution?
> *   Which audiences are most likely to engage with you this way, and how can you meet their needs?
> *   What are the trends in mobile delivery for .edu sites, and how can your institution get started?

> After registering you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the Webinar.

Posts will pick up towards the end of the week as I go into the technical details behind those projects that are launching tomorrow. Got some neat tricks coming.
