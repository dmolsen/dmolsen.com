I'll be speaking at [Refresh Pittsburgh][1] ([@refreshpitt][2]) next **Tuesday, May 15th at 6.30pm**. I'm really excited about this talk since it's about a new technology, **Responsive Web Design + Server Side Components (RESS)**, that I think holds much promise as we learn to deliver complicated responsive designs while standards get firmed up. Here is the talk description:

> Responsive web design has become an important tool for front-end developers as they develop mobile-optimized solutions for clients. Browser-detection has been an important tool for server-side developers for the same task for much longer. Unfortunately, both techniques have certain limitations. I'll show how both front-end and server-side developers can take advantage of the new technique called RESS (*Responsive Web Design with Server Side Components*) that aims to be combine the best of both worlds for delivering mobile-optimized content.

If the talk sounds interesting here are some useful links to get some more background (*though I will obviously cover all this in the talk*):

*   [RESS: Responsive Design + Server Side Components][3] by Luke Wroblewski ([@lukew][4])
*   [Which One: Responsive Design, Device Experiences, or RESS?][5] by Luke Wroblewski ([@lukew][4])
*   [RESS, Server-side Feature-detection and the Evolution of Responsive Web Design][6] by me

I'll also be talking a little bit about my work with [Detector][7].

By the way, the other talk that night will be given by Patrick Fulton ([@patrickfulton][8]) and is on Compass. The description:

> This presentation is an overview of Compass, which is a CSS authoring framework that tackles common stylesheet problems such as grid layouts, handling CSS3 vendor differences, and stylesheet optimization. It does for CSS what jQuery has done for JavaScript: solve real world problems, letting designers and developers create stylesheets more efficiently.
