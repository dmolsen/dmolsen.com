Their are two upcoming conferences that are near and dear to me that are currently looking for presentation proposals. Please think about submitting a proposal for one or, better yet, both.

## HighEdWeb National

The first is the [national HighEdWeb conference][1] which is being held in Milwaukee October 7-10. Milwaukee may not sound like the best location to spend a few days in chilly October but that's more than made up for by the warm crowd. And it truly is a warm, friendly crowd of people who you can really commiserate with and learn from. It's one conference where the connections grow beyond the conference itself. I haven't been to national since the move away from Rochester but I'm hoping to change that this year. The deadline for submission for proposals is April 21st. You can submit ideas for a poster session or a 45 minute talk. Registration is $600 before July 31 but if you get accepted for a talk you save $100. A great deal. Go [submit a proposal now][2].

## HighEdWeb Arkansas

The second is the [regional HighEdWeb Arkansas][3] conference July 26-27. It's being held in Little Rock. If you live within driving distance and want a nice, intimate higher ed conference experience then this is the one for you. I presented at another regional last year (*HighEdWeb Rochester*) and was impressed with the local connections that people were able to make. I'm [running a workshop ][4]at HighEdWeb Arkansas this year and I'm looking forward to mingling with folks from a different part of the country. The deadline for submission of proposals is April 20th. If you've never spoken before but have something to share or want to roll out new material (*which is what I did*) this is a great venue to do it in. Go [submit a proposal now][5].

PS – Another conference I'm presenting at, the [Web Conference at Penn State][6], is almost full. Make sure to [register now][7] if you haven't already.
