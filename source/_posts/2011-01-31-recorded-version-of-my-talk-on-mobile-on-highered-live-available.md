My discussion with Seth Odell ([@sethodell][1]) about mobile on his show, [HigherEd Live][2] ([@higheredlive][3]), is [now available for your viewing pleasure][4]. We had some technical difficulties before the show so it might not be as polished as some might hope but I had a ton of fun talking with Seth. Blog posts sharing some more stats and my views on a progressive mobile strategy for higher ed (*that builds on a *[*previous one*][5]) will be coming this week. If there are any other questions I can answer drop a line in the comments below.

If you're curious about my headphones they are theÂ [Sony MDR-V6][6] Studio Monitor headphones. And the cap is for [US Soccer][7].
