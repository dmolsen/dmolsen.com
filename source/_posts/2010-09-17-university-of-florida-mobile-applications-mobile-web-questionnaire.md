The fine folks at the [University of Florida][1], led by Bruce Floyd ([@brucefloyd][2]), are currently [conducting a survey][3] regarding higher education mobile applications and the mobile web. I've already submitted info for our school but I'm sure they could use a cross-section of opinions/experiences. Should take about 10 minutes or so. If you've developed a mobile app or website for your school please take a moment to help them out. [Check out the form][3] on Google Docs.
