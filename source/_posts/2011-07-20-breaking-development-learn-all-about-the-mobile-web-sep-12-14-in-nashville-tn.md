Every year I get to go to one conference. Last year I attended my first "industry" conference by going to *Design for Mobile*. This year I've made a similar decision and I'll be attending *[Breaking Development][1]*. The conference description:

> Breaking Development focuses on new, emerging techniques for web development and design for mobile devices. Our speakers are hand-picked to make sure you get challenging, well-delivered talks from a variety of different perspectives.

While I will be missing out on a good time and good info at a conference like *[HighEdWeb][2]* I'm excited to once again focus on mobile & only mobile. Two of the great features of the *Breaking Development* conference are the small crowd (*attendance capped at 250*) and a [who's who line-up][3] of [approachable][4] and [knowledgeable][5] speakers. If it's anything like *Design for Mobile* last year I expect that you could make some useful connections with other attendees and the speakers as well as have your brain melted by the talks.

The kicker is that **if you sign-up before July 25th you'll save $200 on registration**. So if you're interested make sure you get permission and [register quickly][6].

If you're going to the conference drop a line in the comments. Maybe we can get a higher ed meet-up together to share notes and best practices.
