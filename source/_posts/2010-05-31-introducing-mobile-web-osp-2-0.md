The code that powers [West Virginia University's mobile site][1] has been released as [Mobile Web OSP 2.0][2]. The [code][3] is a fork of the original version 0.9 of  the [MIT Mobile Web][4] project that can still be found on [SourceForge][5]. The highlights include:

*   Theme Support
*   [jQTouch][6] & [jQuery][7] Support
*   Reorganization of templates with the addition of WebKit templates
*   Favorites Feature Using HTML5
*   Integration with [iWVU][8], an [Open Sourced iPhone App][9]

You can get more details in the [release notes][10]. [Screenshots][11] of WVU's implementation are available on Flickr.

Almost [all of the documentation][2] for the original v1.0 release of Mobile Web OSP has been updated. I'm simply missing images that show examples of the styles. The Basic and Touch template documentation will probably be useful for anyone using MIT's code. [Code is available on GitHub][12].  Feel free to fork the project. For those folks who really like Subversion GitHub now supports Subversion read and write as well.

If you want to stay updated on the project and have a Twitter account you can follow [@mobilewebosp][13]. The [road map for the project][14] has also been updated.
