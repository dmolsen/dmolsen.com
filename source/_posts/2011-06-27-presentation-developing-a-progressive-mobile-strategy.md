Today, at 10.45am eastern, I'll be presenting "*Developing a Progressive Mobile Strategy*" to the fine folks at [HighEdWeb Rochester][1]. Here is the slidedeck for those who want to follow from home. The hashtag for the conference is **#hewebroc**. <del>I had hoped to include the script for the talk as notes on the slidedeck but my Keynote presentation was too big for Slideshare so I simply exported it as PDF. I'll run back this week and update the notes when I have time.</del> The notes have now been added on SlideShare. Hope you find the talk useful. Also, there is now a [PDF version][2] that is available.
