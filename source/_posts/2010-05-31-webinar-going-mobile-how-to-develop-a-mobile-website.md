On August 4th, 2010 I'll be presenting a webinar for [HigherEdExperts.com][1] entitled "[Going Mobile: How to Develop a Mobile Website][2]." It covers why an institution should have a mobile website and how to go about implementing one quickly using [Mobile Web OSP 2.0][3].

With the webinar you get:

*   a pre-recorded session – that can be watched on demand – showing the step-by-step development of an institutional mobile website. This session is available June 28th so perfect for a late summer project!
*   a live presentation explaining the main development principles and addressing questions from the audience.

The cost for the webinar is $300 and is for a single connection with an unlimited number of attendees at that connection
