[California Lutheran University][1] recently launched their [mobile website][2] built with version 2 ofÂ [Mobile Web OSP][3]. They did a great job modifying the look and functionality of the system to make it there own. One thing I'm really impressed by is their [introductory video][4] to show folks how the mobile website can be useful to them on campus. The best part might be the ending. Check it out below:

It's such a great way to show off campus mobile services.

There are now [12 schools using Mobile Web OSP][5]. Also, remember to check out the [full list of mobile sites in higher ed][6] that I'm aware of. Using Mobile Web OSP or just have a mobile site then [let me know][7].
