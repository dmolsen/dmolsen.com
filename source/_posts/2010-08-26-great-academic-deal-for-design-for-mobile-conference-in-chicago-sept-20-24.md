I will be attending the *Design for Mobile* conference in Chicago between October 20-24, 2010. The conference bills itself as:

> **Design for Mobile** is the first and only North American mobile user experience conference. The focus is on strategy and tactics for user research, product definition, interaction and other design, and usability testing.

While I thought the [conference schedule][1] looked great and saw that there were a lot of [great speakers][2] presenting at itÂ the thing that really tipped the scales for me was the price. ***It's only $500 for academic professionals***. That price does mean we miss out on preliminary and advanced workshops but I think it'll still be well worth it. Regular price for those three days looks like it'd be $1,800 or so. So definitely a generous deal.

I think the thing I'm most looking forward to learning more about at the conference is user-centered design in the mobile space. I get so caught up in implementing the technical details that I sometimes lose sight of what's really wanted or what will actually work best for the user. Hopefully that knowledge can be transferred to [Mobile Web OSP][3] so that other institutions can also benefit.

For folks on [Twitter][4] the conference hashtag is [#d4m2010][5] and here are the Twitter handles for some of the speakers (*the ones I'm following at least*):

*   [@barbaraballard][6]
*   [@d4m][7]
*   [@globalmoxie][8]
*   [@grigs][9]
*   [@ianhomer][10]
*   [@karthur][11]
*   [@lukew][12]
*   [@suzanneginsburg][13]

If you're going to the conference drop a line in the comments. Maybe we can get a higher ed meet-up together to share notes and best practices.
