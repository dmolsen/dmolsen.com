*Update:* Well, this talk has come and go. Check out the [slidedeck][1]...

I'll be giving a talk, entitled [Developing a Progressive Mobile Strategy][2], at [HighEdWeb Rochester][3] on June 27. It's essentially going to be a reboot of an [old blog post][4] of mine based on what we've learned about mobile at West Virginia University over the last two years. The conference has a [nice set of talks][5] with several touching on mobile. It appears that space is filling up fast for the conference so [make sure to register][6].  Hey, it's $30 and you'll get to meet a bunch of great folks. Frankly, I'm looking forward to talking to & sharing with other higher ed folks as much as attending the talks. Hopefully, I'll get to meet a few readers there too. Drop me a line if you're going!
