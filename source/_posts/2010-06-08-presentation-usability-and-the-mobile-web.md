Rose Pruyne, [@rpruyne][1], posted a [great presentation][2] she gave from the [Penn State Web Conference 2010][3] entitled "[Usability and the Mobile Web][2]." It includes some great numbers on usage and insights from Jakob Nielsen's "[Usability of Mobile Websites][4]" report ([some more highlights from it][5]). The "insights" get a little scary half-way through but the whole presentation closes nicely. Hopefully next year the crew at Penn State can open the conference up to outsiders. From following the hashtag, [#psuweb10][6], it sounds like a great group of people and talks. Lots of info.
