If you're interested in checking out some general best practices when developing your mobile appli[cation you can check out the W3C's Mobile Web Application Best Practices][1]. It's a great guide. You can [check out the announcement][2] or [go directly to the best practices document][1]. One thing that I know I haven't taken advantage of with my projects are [sprites][3]. It's something I really should learn more about. The building icons in our campus map listing would be a perfect place to use sprites.
