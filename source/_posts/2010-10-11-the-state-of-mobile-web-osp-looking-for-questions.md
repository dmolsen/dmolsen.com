Over the next few weeks I'd like to put together a post entitled "State of Mobile Web OSP." I figure it'll come out after my trip next week to Las Vegas for the [SIM Tech 2010][1] conference.

For those who are new to this blog,Â [Mobile Web OSP][2] is a PHP-based framework that I maintain. It is designed to make it easier for universities and colleges to deliver mobile portals. It has been [open sourced][3] under the MIT license. The code for my project is a fork of v0.9 of MIT's original MIT Mobile Web product.

While I definitely have ideas about what I'd like to talk about regarding the state of the project and the future direction I expect it to take I'm sure I'm not going to cover everything that folks would like to hear about. So with that in mind, "What are your questions regarding the state of the project?" Feel free to drop me a line via [the contact form][4] or via the comments.

**Update November 17, 2010:** The [State of Mobile Web OSP post][5] is now available.
