This morning I had the pleasure of presenting my new talk, [The Future-Friendly Campus][1], at the [.eduGuru Summit][2]Â ([@eduguru][3]). The basic points of the talk are derived from the [Future-Friendly manifesto][4] and [my own response to it][5] last fall. The general idea is that we've reached a point where it's going to be difficult to continue to on our current track of developing content silos and new "solutions" when our outlets are only going to continue to proliferate. Now is the time to reevaluate and the [Future-Friendly manifesto][4] provides an interesting idea of how we can move forward. If you have comments or questions please share!
