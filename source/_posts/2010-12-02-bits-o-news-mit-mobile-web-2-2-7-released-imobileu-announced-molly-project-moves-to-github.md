Some interesting bits of news going on in the world of higher education and mobileâ€¦

## MIT Mobile Web 2.2.7 Released

The folks at MIT have [released v2.2.7 of their framework on GitHub][1]. [Mobile Web OSP][2] is originally based on v0.9 of that project. In order to use the new version you'll also have to download and set-up [MIT's Mobile Service 2.1][3] (*aka device detection*) which is [available on GitHub][3] as well. Their are some [other requirements][4] as well for using the new version.

**Special note:** if you see the "download demo" link on the requirements page be aware that it's not the demo for v2.2.7 but an entirely new version of the framework.

## iMobileU Announced

As part of the effort to support their project, MIT and [Modo Labs][5] (*a spin-off of the folks who created the original framework and who have worked on [Harvards mobile site][6]*) have announced [iMobileU][7]. It's actually been around for a while simply as a listserv and a bi-weekly conference call but they now have a [web presence][8]. It's mainly focused on supporting schools using the MIT Mobile Framework but they're definitely open to questions regarding general issues in mobile and higher ed.

## Molly Project Moves to GitHub

The folks at the [Molly Project][9], a Python-based mobile framework that [I've talked about before][10], [announced this week][11] that they're [moving their project to GitHub][12]. [GitHub][13] seems to be the place to be now for higher ed mobile frameworks as [MIT Mobile Web][1], [Mobile Web OSP][14], and now [Molly][12] are all there. Another thing they announced is that they're going to be using [Tender][15] for support. I'm really curious to see how this goes and may follow them if it works out.
