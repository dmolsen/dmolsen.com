I'm thrilled to announce that *Mobile in Higher Ed* is now a part of the [BlogHighEd][1] community. BlogHighEd acts as a blog aggregator bringing together many different perspectives on higher ed in one place. It's a great resource for any higher ed professional looking to keep up with the latest and greatest. I'm really humbled to be included in a great incoming class that joins the already established stalwarts of higher ed blogging. Many thanks to Brad Ward ([@bradjward][2]), Matt Herzberger ([@mherzber][3]) and the rest of the BlogHighEd community for including me. I encourage you to check out the [current blogroll][1], to [add BlogHighEd to  your RSS reader][4], and follow [@bloghighed][5] on Twitter.
