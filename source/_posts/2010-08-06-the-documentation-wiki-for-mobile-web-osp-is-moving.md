This is just a general housekeeping update. Because of a trademark issue with the address I have for the current wiki I'm need to move the documentation to a new address. I'm leaving up the [old wiki][1] for a few more weeks but the [new wiki][2] can be found at [http://mobilewebosp.pbworks.com/][3]. Same content, same look and feel, just a different address.

And sorry for the lack of content here. Between vacations in June and then a July filled with troubleshooting problems with our CMS I haven't been thinking about mobile much. New posts should start trickling out shortly.

Anything in particular you want me to address? Drop a line in the comments.
