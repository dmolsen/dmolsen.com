All this week EDUCAUSE is hosting what they term a [5-day sprint on the very large topic of mobile computing][1]. Each day is built around a specific mobile computing topic and includes a free webinar. Unfortunately I believe most of the webinars are "sold out" but EDUCAUSE is posting them for free very quickly after the events. More info on the sprint is available in EDUCAUSE's [Sprint 101 page][2]. There is a niceÂ [recap of yesterday's events][3]. One of the more interesting opportunities for discussion during the event is the [IdeaScale forum][4]. And you can also follow on Twitter by following the hashtag [#EDUsprint][5].

If you're interested in mobile in higher ed I hope you can join in.
