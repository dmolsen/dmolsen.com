If you're looking to fill 25 minutes during your day, you can now [check out the video][1] of my Freshly Squeezed Mobile talk, "[Developing a Progressive Mobile Strategy][2]," that I gave at Breaking Development ([@bdconf][3]) in September. The [slide deck][2] from that talk is available on SlideShare.

[Dave Olsen – Developing a Progressive Mobile Strategy – BD Conf, Sept 2011][1] from [Breaking Development][4] on [Vimeo][5].

The folks at Breaking Development are slowly [sharing the videos of the other talks][6] at the September event. I highly, highly encourage you to check them out. Many thanks to them for sharing mine and the others.
