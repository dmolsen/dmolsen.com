This Sunday, January 30th, 2011, at 7pm EST I'll be talking mobile on Seth Odell's ([@sethodell][1]) web show, [HigherEd Live][2] ([@HigherEdLive][3]). We'll be talking about the current state of mobile in higher ed, some strategies you can follow to get going, and some tools you can use. I'll also be sharing statistics from our fall 2010 semester as well as information that I've found from a survey of the sites found in the [higher ed mobile directory][4]. While it will be recorded, please join us live  so you can ask questions in real-time. I'm also sure Seth will be as high-energy as usual. 

And if you're not completely sold on watching we're giving away a FREE pass to my Going Mobile webinar from [HigherEdExperts][5] in May – a $350 value!
