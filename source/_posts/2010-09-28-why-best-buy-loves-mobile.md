This video from [Best Buy][1] (*debuted at the National Retail Federation's 2010 Retail Innovation & Marketing Conference*) really sums up what getting into mobile means for  a company or institution. It also shows why a broad progressive mobile strategy is so important for delivering successful mobile solutions. I'm struggling with my write-up for what I mean by a progressive mobile strategy but hopefully this video offers some hints.
