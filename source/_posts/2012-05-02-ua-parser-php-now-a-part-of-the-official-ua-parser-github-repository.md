For fans of user-agent detection I'm pleased to announce that [ua-parser-php][1], my pseudo-port of the original Python-based ua-parser project, has now been rolled into the [official ua-parser repository on GitHub][2]. The [official repo][2] now contains JavaScript, Python, and PHP libraries for all your user-agent detection needs. We now have three folks watching over the official repository and, more importantly, the official YAML file that powers all three libraries. I'm looking forward to seeing how all three evolve.

Thanks to Tobie Langel ([@tobie][3]) and Lindsey Simon ([@elsigh][4]) for including my library in the official repo and Paul Irish ([@paul_irish][5]) for getting us all together.
