During Friday night's nationally-televised [West Virginia University][1] football game on ESPN2 WVU's mobile website, [WVU Mobile Web][2], will be making a brief appearance. During every game a commercial from each school is shown. During this game a new recruitment commercial for WVU will be shown for the first time on ESPN. In it the featured student uses the campus map feature of WVU Mobile Web. I'm surprised and thrilled to see the website included. In case you don't plan to watch the game and catch the commercial on TV you can [view the spot on YouTube][3] (*also embedded below*). Enjoy!
