I [gave a talk][1] at [RefreshPittsburgh][2] ([@refreshpitt][3]) last night that hopefully served as an introduction to [RESS][4] and [Detector][5]. I believe RESS  can help developers address some of the realities of deploying Responsive Web Design-based sites so it was awesome to share the concept. I can't thank Jason Head ([@gjhead][6]), Val Head ([@valh][7]), and Geoff Barnes ([@texburgher][8]) enough for giving me the opportunity to present. It was a really fun time with a good group both during and after the event and I can't recommend Refresh Pitt enough. The other talk of the night, given by Patrick Fulton ([@patrickfulton][9]), reviewed [Compass][10] and was really informative. If you're in Morgantown or Pittsburgh make sure you follow [@refreshpitt][3] on Twitter and attend the next event.

The talk description:

> Responsive web design has become an important tool for front-end developers as they develop mobile-optimized solutions for clients. Browser-detection has been an important tool for server-side developers for the same task for much longer. Unfortunately, both techniques have certain limitations. I'll show how both front-end and server-side developers can take advantage of the new technique called RESS (*Responsive Web Design with Server Side Components*) that aims to be combine the best of both worlds for delivering mobile-optimized content.

Intrigued? Here is the deck:
