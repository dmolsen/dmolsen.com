This week I'm in Las Vegas attending [Stamats][1] [SIM Tech][2]. Actually, I'm not just attending but I've gotten the chance to present. [Facebook Platform][3] was the topic I chose. I've posted [my presentation][4] to SlideShare and it comes with my complete script. So if you check out the notes for each slide you'll see what I (*roughly*) talked about. I talked about what Facebook Platform is, two core reasons why a school should think about using it, and some of the cool tools ([social plugins][5] & [authentication][6]) an institution can use to quickly make their websites more social and interactive.

One of my big inspirations for the talk was a talk by Luke Wroblewski ([@lukew][7]) entitled, "[Sign-up Forms Must Die][8]". Go check that out as well. He has video as well as a PDF.
