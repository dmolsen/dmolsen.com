This week there were two nice blog posts regarding how a few schools are implementing mobile websites:

*   [Mobile PittState: How We Did It With No Money and Resources][1] by Michael Fienen, [@fienen][2], &
*   [Going Mobile][3] by Mike Nolan, [@mikenolan][4]

Just wanted to make sure folks got a chance to read them.
