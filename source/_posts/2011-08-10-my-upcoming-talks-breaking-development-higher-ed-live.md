I'll be making two appearances in the next month or so. One is online and the other one will be in person.

### Higher Ed Live

**This Sunday, August 14th**, **at 7pm Eastern** I'll be appearing on the [Higher Ed Live web show][1] to talk mobile strategy with Seth Odell ([@sethodell][2]). I've been in training for the last few weeks so I'm hoping I can keep up with Mr. High Energy. Folks can contribute to the show by taking to Twitter with the hashtag [#higheredlive][3]. As with any of the Higher Ed Live shows it promises to be a good time. I'll even keep the hat off for this show.

### Breaking Development

I'm really excited to be able to share that I will be speaking this September at the [Breaking Development conference][4] as part of their Freshly Squeezed Mobile series. Here's the description for my talk entitled "*Developing a Progressive Mobile Strategy*."

> A common refrain from both management and clients alike today is, "We need an app…" Unfortunately, over the long-term, mobile solutions for you or your clients' organizations will need to be more diversified than a single app. From optimizing current web content to developing unique experiences mobile will touch, and possibly transform, your entire enterprise. Not only will your interactions with your customers be affected by the rapid adoption of smartphones but also your workforce and business processes. Combining lessons learned at a large, land-grant university as well as the latest statistics on mobile we'll review why you need a cross-audience, cross-content, and cross-platform mobile strategy, what one is all about, and how it'll help you prioritize your mobile solutions.

The rest of the speakers & topics at the conference make up [a hell of a line-up][5]. As much as I'm looking forward to giving the talk I'm really looking forward to meeting the other attendees. If you're going make sure to drop a line in the comments.
