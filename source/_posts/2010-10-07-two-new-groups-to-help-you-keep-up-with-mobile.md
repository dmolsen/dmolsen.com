Two new groups have been recently created related to mobile might be of interest to you:

## Mobile Group on University Web Developers

Mark Greenfield ([@markgr][1]) recently created a new [mobile group][2] over at the [uwebd Social Network][3]. The group is being moderated by yours truly. Got questions about anything in mobile (SMS, native apps, QR codes, etc.)? Then please feel free to drop a line over there. We're hoping it can be a good resource for higher ed as mobile becomes a bigger part of our day-to-day operations. Honestly, if you're in higher ed, deal with anything web- or social media-related and haven't joined this [great network][3] you really should. Seriously, [join][2].

## Mobile Web on Yahoo! Groups

Over on Yahoo! Groups Peter-Paul Koch ([@ppk][4]) has set-up a [group focused specifically on mobile web][5]. Some interesting discussions so far. Hopefully as Brian Fling's ([@fling][6]) [mobile webÂ manifesto][7] gets some more play the traffic will continue to increase. There are already a bunch of great people participating. Also, Peter's site, [Quirksmode][8], is a great resource for any developer.
