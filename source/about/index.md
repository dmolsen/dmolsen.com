My name is Dave Olsen. I'm a programmer and sometimes project manager with [West Virginia University](http://www.wvu.edu/). I specialize in delivering PHP- and Ruby on Rails-based solutions for our [University Relations](http://www.ur.wvu.edu/) department. Since July 2009 much of my work has been related to mobile. The most robust of these projects is [WVU Mobile Web](http://m.wvu.edu) which has been open sourced as [Mobile Web OSP][4]. I've created a number of other solutions as well and you can learn more about them on my [projects page](/projects/).
